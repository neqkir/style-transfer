Deep Learning for Text Style Transfer: A Survey https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.00416.pdf <sup>[1](#tst1)</sup>

Sometimes we have parallel data at hands ; for instance, a set of pairs of sentences, each pair expresses the same idea in a formal and informal way respectively. In a majority of cases no parallel data are available and the majority of text style transfer (TST) methods assume only non-parallel mono-style corpora. 

Three main branches of text style transfer methods for non-parallel data:

* disentanglement 
* prototype editing
* pseudo-parallel corpus construction
